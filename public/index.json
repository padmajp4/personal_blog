How is it different from DevOps? And why is everyone from Google to startups investing in it?\nLet’s break it down.\n💡 What is Site Reliability Engineering? Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is a discipline that blends software engineering with IT operations. Coined by Google, SRE is about automating operations and ensuring systems are scalable, reliable, and efficient.\nAt its core, SRE answers one big question:\n“How do we run large-scale services reliably and consistently — and improve them over time?”\n🔍 SRE vs DevOps: What’s the Difference? While DevOps focuses on collaboration between development and operations, SRE is DevOps with an engineer’s mindset. It’s more prescriptive and emphasizes metrics, error budgets, and automation.\nAspect DevOps SRE Philosophy Culture \u0026amp; collaboration Engineering \u0026amp; automation Approach Broad guidelines Specific practices \u0026amp; metrics Metrics Uptime, delivery frequency SLOs, SLAs, SLIs, error budgets Tools CI/CD, monitoring Same, but with heavy automation 🧰 Core Principles of SRE 1. SLOs, SLIs, and SLAs Service Level Objectives (SLO): Desired reliability targets Service Level Indicators (SLI): Metrics (e.g., latency, availability) Service Level Agreements (SLA): External commitments (usually legal) 2. Error Budgets A brilliant concept: rather than striving for 100% uptime (impossible!), SRE allows some failure — defined by the error budget.\nIf your SLO is 99.9%, your budget is 0.1% downtime.\n3. Toil Reduction Toil = manual, repetitive work. SREs aim to automate everything.\nLess toil = more time for innovation.\n4. Blameless Postmortems When things break (they will), SREs run transparent postmortems focused on learning, not blaming.\n🛠️ What Do SREs Actually Do? Build and maintain monitoring and alerting systems Write automation to handle deployments, scaling, and failures Track performance and reliability metrics Participate in incident response Collaborate with developers to build more reliable systems 🌍 Why SRE Matters In today’s always-on digital world, downtime is expensive — financially and reputationally.\nSRE brings the discipline, structure, and mindset needed to:\nReduce downtime Increase developer velocity Scale services globally Improve customer experience 🔚 Final Thoughts SRE isn’t just a buzzword — it’s a necessary evolution in running software at scale. Whether you’re managing a microservice architecture or a monolith, reliability must be baked into your engineering culture, not bolted on as an afterthought.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re passionate about systems, love automation, and want to sit at the intersection of dev and ops — SRE might just be your calling.\n💬 Got thoughts or questions about SRE?

To control how your image looks, you need to understand three fundamental settings on your camera: ISO, Shutter Speed, and Aperture. Together, they form what is called the Exposure Triangle.\n📷 The Exposure Triangle The exposure triangle is a visual model that helps photographers balance three key elements to achieve a well-exposed photograph.\n1. ISO 📈 ISO refers to your camera sensor\u0026rsquo;s sensitivity to light.\nLow ISO (e.g., 100) = Less sensitivity = Cleaner images with less noise. High ISO (e.g., 3200 or more) = More sensitivity = Brighter images in low light but with more grain/noise. Tip: Use the lowest ISO possible for the cleanest result unless light is limited.\n2. Shutter Speed ⏱️ Shutter speed is how long the camera shutter stays open.\nFast shutter (1/1000 sec) freezes motion (great for sports). Slow shutter (1/10 sec or slower) captures motion blur or low light (great for night shots or light trails). Tip: Always match shutter speed to your subject’s motion. Use a tripod for long exposures.\n3. Aperture 🔘 (f-stop) Aperture controls how wide the lens opens to let in light.\nWide aperture (f/1.8) = More light + shallow depth of field (blurry background). Narrow aperture (f/16) = Less light + more in focus. Tip: Portraits benefit from wide apertures. Landscapes benefit from narrow ones.\n🎯 Balancing the Triangle Changing one setting affects the others. For example, if you increase the shutter speed (letting in less light), you may need to raise the ISO or open the aperture to compensate.\nUnderstanding this relationship gives you creative control over:\nExposure Motion blur Background blur (bokeh) Image quality Final Thoughts Mastering the exposure triangle is essential to move from auto to manual mode. Start experimenting with each setting individually to see how they affect your shots. Over time, you\u0026rsquo;ll begin to make decisions instinctively.\nHappy shooting! 📸\n","title":"Photography Basics"}],"tags":[{"link":"/tags/camera/","name":"Camera","slug":"Camera"},{"link":"/tags/devops/","name":"DevOps","slug":"DevOps"},{"link":"/tags/image/","name":"Image","slug":"Image"},{"link":"/tags/infrastructure/","name":"Infrastructure","slug":"Infrastructure"},{"link":"/tags/photo/","name":"Photo","slug":"Photo"},{"link":"/tags/reliability/","name":"Reliability","slug":"Reliability"},{"link":"/tags/sre/","name":"SRE","slug":"SRE"}]}
